# Web Cache Deception - Lab Series

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive series of hands-on labs exploring **Web Cache Deception** vulnerabilities. These labs progress from foundational concepts to expert-level exploitation techniques, demonstrating real-world attack scenarios against misconfigured caching systems.

## What is Web Cache Deception?

Web Cache Deception is a vulnerability that occurs when there are **normalization discrepancies** between cache layers (CDNs, reverse proxies) and origin servers. Attackers exploit these differences to trick the cache into storing sensitive, authenticated content under publicly accessible cache keys.

### Attack Mechanism

1. **Attacker crafts malicious URL** using path manipulation, delimiters, or encoding
2. **Cache layer** interprets the URL as a static, cacheable resource
3. **Origin server** normalizes the URL differently, serving dynamic authenticated content
4. **Cache stores** the authenticated response as if it were public static content
5. **Attacker retrieves** cached sensitive data without authentication

### Real-World Impact

- 🔓 **Authentication bypass** - Access protected resources without credentials
- 🔑 **Credential exposure** - Extract API keys, tokens, and session data
- 👤 **Account takeover** - Steal CSRF tokens and hijack user sessions
- 📊 **Data exfiltration** - Access personal information, financial data, PII
- 🎯 **Privilege escalation** - Compromise administrative accounts

## Tools & Setup

### Required Tools
- **Burp Suite Professional** - Primary testing platform
  - Proxy for traffic interception
  - Repeater for request manipulation
  - Intruder for systematic fuzzing
  - CSRF PoC Generator (Lab 5)
- **Web Browser** - Session management and authentication
- **PortSwigger Academy Account** - Lab access and exploit server

### Environment Setup
1. Configure browser proxy settings (127.0.0.1:8080)
2. Install Burp Suite CA certificate
3. Create PortSwigger Academy account
4. Familiarize yourself with Burp Suite tools

## Common Attack Patterns

### Pattern 1: Extension-Based Deception
```
/sensitive-endpoint.js
/api/user-data.css
/my-account.png
```
**Cache sees:** Static file extension → Cache  
**Origin sees:** Dynamic endpoint → Serve authenticated content

### Pattern 2: Delimiter Exploitation
```
/my-account?foo.js
/api/data;static.css
/profile#/../resources/style.css
```
**Cache sees:** Static resource indicator → Cache  
**Origin sees:** Delimiter truncates/normalizes → Serve dynamic content

### Pattern 3: Path Traversal with Encoding
```
/account/../resources/static.js
/api/..%2Fresources%2Fstyle.css
/data;%2f%2e%2e%2frobots.txt
```
**Cache sees:** Literal path with static indicator → Cache  
**Origin sees:** Decoded/normalized path → Serve sensitive endpoint

### Pattern 4: Cache Key Exclusions
```
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com
Origin: https://evil.com
```
**Cache sees:** Excludes certain headers from key → Wrong cached content  
**Origin sees:** Full request with manipulated headers → Serve user-specific data

## Defense Mechanisms

### Secure Configuration Checklist

**Cache Layer:**
- ✅ Implement unified URL normalization with origin server
- ✅ Use explicit allowlists for cacheable resources (no prefix matching)
- ✅ Include authentication state in cache key generation
- ✅ Set strict Cache-Control headers on dynamic content
- ✅ Validate delimiter handling matches origin server behavior

**Origin Server:**
- ✅ Return `Cache-Control: no-store, private` on authenticated endpoints
- ✅ Implement consistent delimiter parsing
- ✅ Reject ambiguous URLs with encoded traversal sequences
- ✅ Use separate domains for static vs dynamic content

**Security Monitoring:**
- ✅ Alert on cache hits for dynamic/authenticated endpoints
- ✅ Monitor unusual URL patterns (encoded characters, delimiters)
- ✅ Log cache key generation for security audits
- ✅ Track rapid sequential access to recently cached resources

## Testing Methodology

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Map application endpoints (authenticated vs public)
   - Identify sensitive data locations
   - Analyze cache behavior (headers, timing)

2. **Cache Policy Discovery**
   - Test basic path modifications
   - Identify cached vs non-cached resources
   - Document cache headers and TTL values

3. **Delimiter Fuzzing**
   - Use Burp Intruder with delimiter payloads
   - Test both raw and encoded characters
   - Identify normalization discrepancies

4. **Exploit Construction**
   - Combine findings into attack URL
   - Test cache poisoning with authenticated session
   - Verify unauthorized cache retrieval

5. **Impact Validation**
   - Extract sensitive data from cache
   - Document exploitability and impact
   - Test persistence and scope
